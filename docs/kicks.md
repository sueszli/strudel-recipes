Distinct kicks:

- Sara Landry
- Holy Priest
- AZYR
- Nicolas Julian
- Nikolina
- Vinka Wydro

```
if you were to describe the distinct sound of the kicks from these artists to a music producer who had never heard them before as technical as possible, such that they're able to reproduce it faithfully in their own work, how would you exactly describe the sound of the kick drum of these artists?

- Sara Landry
- Holy Priest
- AZYR
- Nicolas Julian
- Nikolina
- Vinka Wydro
